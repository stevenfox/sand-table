# TASK

There is a Line chart displaying the amount of total spends from agents.
The graph has been developed using VueJS Cli3 and charts.js library

My apologies for not having all the tasks completed. I didnâ€™t have enough time.

#If I had some more
I would create more graphs using d3 as it is more powerful js library.
In addition i would make it with dynamic json load and not hard coded sample values.

Please feel free to ask me for any question. 

Thank you for your time.
